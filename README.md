# ArduCAM
A refractored version of ArduCAM, keep away from distro because massive changes!
I was trying to use ArduCAM with Teensy and ESP8266 but had a lot of problems, so I focused on software and I decided to clean
it and get better results. I already proposed a Pull to Lee, the developer, but at the end this wasn't enough and I decided to write a separate branch
because the massive changes. Nobody likes to do massive changes as Pull request!
All copyrights and licences are the same of the original version and this one it's here just for study.
It actually works perfect with ESP8266 and Teensy 3.0, 3.1 but I have in mind massive changes in the code organization since the library
carry the initializations of many cameras and I want to avoid this!
Some example has been modified to use the new library extension, some other not, but this is a working on project so things will change even
more, I'll wait the scheme it's clear before change all examples and since I own only one camera it will take time.
